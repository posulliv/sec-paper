\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have presented a new mechanism using an advanced binary rewriter
that allows end users to retrofit powerful security features into
third-party, binary-only software. The particular mechanisms we used
are well known, and some have been partially implemented in other
tools.  Our system will allow end-users to retrofit program-level
security protections for the first time in a highly customizable
manner according to their needs and environment.

We demonstrated the effectiveness of our mechanism via experimental
evaluation, begining with the benchmarks developed by Wilander and
Kamkar. We successfully mitigated all the attack forms in the
benchmarks. We then went on to demonstrate how our mechanism
successfully defends against multiple real-world attacks. We also
measured the overheads of our binary rewriter in isolation and then we
showed what the overhead of adding the security mechanism to a binary
is. In both cases, we demonstrated that the overhead introduced is
quite low.

Future work involves extending the binary rewriter to work on more
substantial applications and demonstrating that the mechanism defends
against more real-world attacks. Other interesting avenues for future
research are software diversification and self-healing techniques
using the binary rewriter we have developed.
