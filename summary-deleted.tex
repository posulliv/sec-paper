\subsection{Summary}

Current defenses have a number of weaknesses:

\begin{itemize}

\item They are not easily deployable

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Source code for an application is required
  \item An application needs to be compiled with certain information
  \item Hardware support is required
  \end{itemize}

\item Most are not readily available for use and evaluation

\item Some suffer from un-acceptable overheads

\item No scheme is immediately applicable to all binaries

\end{itemize}

Using the novel binary rewriting techniques developed within our research group, we have developed a scheme with the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}

\item It is immediately deployable

\item It is applicable to any binary

\item Access to an application's source code is not required

\item An application does not need to be compiled in any way such that it contains special information e.g. debug or relocation information

\item It has low overheads

\item Many common stack-based buffer overflow attacks are prevented

\end{itemize}
