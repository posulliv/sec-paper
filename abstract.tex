We present a practical tool for inserting security features against
low-level software attacks into third-party, proprietary or otherwise
binary-only software. We are motivated by the inability of software
users to select and use low-overhead protection schemes when source
code is unavailable to them, by the lack of information as to what (if
any) security mechanisms software producers have used in their
toolchains, and the high overhead and inaccuracy of solutions that
treat software as a black box.

Our approach is based on {\it SecondWrite}, an advanced binary
rewriter that operates without need for debugging information or other
assist. Using SecondWrite, we insert a variety of defenses into
program binaries. Although the defenses are generally well known, they
have not generally been used together because they are implemented by
different (non-integrated) tools. We are also the first to demonstrate
the use of such mechanisms in the absence of source code
availability. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness and
performance impact of our approach. We show that it stops all variants
of low-level software attacks at a very low performance overhead,
without impacting original program functionality.
